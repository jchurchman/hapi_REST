## Playing with Server side Frameworks

### Restify!

My first exposure to a server side framework was Express. It was easy, 
seemed efficient, very straight forward. I loved it. Then game the 
vanilla HTTP server. Boy that was an experience. I appreciate Express so 
much more after that. But the notion of checking out other frameworks was
interesting enough to me that I wanted to play around a little more. First
up I tried Koa. That didn't go so well for me. I was new enough to building
a server that I wasn't able to handle the change in construction. So I 
looked to Restify instead. It was basically Express light. The only thing
that I really had problems with was exporting my routes from my app.js file.

I'm sure if I do enough digging, I'll figure it out. But for now, my app will
be as it is. Eventually, I want to experiment with some other server 
frameworks. Maybe Fastify--I've heard good things.
